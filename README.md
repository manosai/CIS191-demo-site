CIS 191 Project 3
-----------------

This is a demo site that is a simplified version of the CIS 191 website. It is
used as a testbed/training ground for Git usage and merge conflict resolution.

1. My git hook will checkout my latest commits to ~/www whenever I push commits to my cloud remote repository. 
2. The directory in my local repository that I push to will be published online so that whenever python server.py is run, the website can be accessed online through port 9001. 
3. A bare repository is a repository that contains the .git folder and no working copies of my source files. It also contains the version history of my code and is used for sharing on a centralized server. 
4. Server address: ec2-54-225-24-140.compute-1.amazonaws.com
